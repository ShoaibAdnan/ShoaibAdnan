# Hi there, I'm Shoaib! 

I'm a full-stack developer who loves building real-world applications and leading teams to deliver great products.

# About Me

I work on large projects like [BenchBoss](https://benchboss-fe.azurewebsites.net), a player performance tracking and game management app; [Fundraiz](https://fundraiz.ca), a lottery management platform; [North Star Payroll](https://northstarpayroll.ca), a payroll management system; and internal tools like the Mainstay Application (a custom job management app developed in .NET) and the NewValve Application (a valve management system built in .NET).

 I help design and manage custom workflow tools that reduce repetitive tasks and improve business efficiency.

 I enjoy working across the full stack, building front-end interfaces with Angular/TypeScript and developing back-end APIs with Node.js and .NET.

 I regularly design, update, and optimize databases to support our growing systems.

 I handle deployments on Azure, including creating and managing environments (such as cost management and monitoring performance) and web app infrastructure.

 I've worked on projects like DRL Tracking & Shipping website (frontend with Angular, backend with MSSQL), and custom Lottery Management Systems for multiple clients.

 I have experience migrating applications and websites to new hosting providers with minimal downtime.

 I've contributed to improving appointment booking systems for businesses like JackAxes, enhancing UI/UX and system performance.

 I oversee project delivery, manage development teams, and ensure smooth integrations between systems and business processes.
